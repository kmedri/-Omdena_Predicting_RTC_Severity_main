        "# Omdena Liverpool Chapter: Predicting RTC serverity using Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "## *THE BACKGROUND*:\n",
        "\n",
        "UK RTCs which have resulted in a persons death have been on a downward trend since the 1960s â€“ however in 2020 1,516 people lost their lives on UK roads. The UK road systems, especially in Liverpool, are dated which means they have not been upgraded to reflect the increase of cars on the road. This means there are still preventative measures that could be implemented to prevent even more deaths on UK roads.\n",
        "\n",
        "The UK government compiles and disseminates extensive data about road incidents around the nation (often once per year). This data is particularly fascinating and thorough for analysis and research because it contains, but is not limited to, geographic areas, weather conditions, vehicle types, casualty numbers, and vehicle manoeuvres.\n",
        "______________\n",
        "## *THE PROBLEM*:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this 4-5 weeks project, the team will be harnessing the power of Machine Learning to predict the severity of RTCs and identify RTC hotspots which would allow the local authority to implement further traffic safety measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "____________________\n",
        "## *TIMELINE*:\n",
        "The entire project is split into two parts of 2 weeks each. In part-1 of the project, our goal is to pre-process the data by transforming the raw data into an understandable format (numerical/categorical etc). Subsequently, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and make statistical decisions. Lastly, our feature engineering to find out the features that have the highest impact on the energy consumption. In part-2, the predictive model will be developed using several supervised learning techniques including ANN, and SVM. Subsequently, the predictive model would be evaluated based on metrics (MSE, MAE etc) and finally, the model is going to be deployed to a dashboard or an app.\n",
